# Kaggle Flower Recognition CNN

## Overview

This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict five types of flowers using the Kaggle Flower Recognition dataset. The five flower types include:

- Daisy
- Dandelion
- Rose
- Sunflower
- Tulip

The original dataset contains 4,242 images.

## Model and Training

A simple CNN with 18 layers is utilized for training and predictions. The key components of the model include:

- Loss Function: Cross Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Activation Function: ReLU
- Maxpooling for feature extraction

## Data Preprocessing

Before training, image preprocessing is performed, including horizontal flipping, resizing to 32x32 pixels, center cropping to 32x32 pixels, conversion to PyTorch tensors, and normalization within the range ((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)).

## Training Accuracy

The model achieves an impressive 97% accuracy during training.

## Usage Notes

To run this project, you'll need to adjust the directory paths in the code to match the location where you've stored the data.
